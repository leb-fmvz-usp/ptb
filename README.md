ptb
===

The ptb  R package is a work in progress to implement functions, under a Bayesian framework, for prevalence estimation, diagnostic test evaluation and prior elicitation. The ptb runs with JAGS (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/) as backend. The functions implemented so far are generalizations of code presented by professor Ian Garner in a course he offered in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. As ptb functions return R objects, other nice packages can be used for model diagnostics.

### Installation

After [installing](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/4.x/) JAGS, use the following commands:  

`library(devtools)`  
`install_github('leb-fmvz-usp/ptb')`
