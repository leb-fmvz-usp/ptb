ptb
===

The R package `ptb` has functions for prevalence estimation, diagnostic test evaluation and prior elicitation. It follows a Bayesian framework and uses [JAGS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/) as a backend. Some of the functions are high-level R versions of [WinBUGS codes](http://cadms.ucdavis.edu/diagnostictests/index.html) and future versions of the `ptb` will translate more of these WinBUGS codes.

### Installation

After [installing](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/4.x/) JAGS, use the following commands:  

`library(devtools)`  
`install_github('leb-fmvz-usp/ptb')`
